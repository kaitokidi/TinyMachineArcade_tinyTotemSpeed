# TinyMachineArcade_tinyTotemSpeed
little game for the tiny machine

The idea is to play with other players.
Pick a phisical totem (any object you like)
press a button, and race to catch it. 
Catch it only when there are no intersections between the lines in the screen!
If you catch it first you win a token.
If someone catch it when it is not suposed to, he/she looses a token.

Compete to see who can have all the tokens!
